Utility package using reflect to add generic functions for dealing with slices of any kind.
Uses reflection heavily to do it's work.

Provides the following features generically to all slice types:
	- Sorting via the sort package, using a user defined comparator.
	- Wrapping a slice into a sortable type and/or a heap using a comparator.
	- Reversing the order of items in a slice
	- Advanced container operations on any slice:
		- insert(slice, index, item)
		- delete(slice, index)
	- Shrinking the capacity of a slice
	- Making a sub-slice where len = cap
